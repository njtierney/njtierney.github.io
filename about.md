Welcome to my website.

My name is Nick. I am a PhD Candidate in Statistics at [QUT](https://www.qut.edu.au/) with [BRAG](https://bragqut.wordpress.com/). My thesis is about creating better methods for modelling occupational health.

I created this website so I can write about what I do, and engage in dialogue with statisticians, programmers, and whoever else is interested. When I write R related posts, they are syndicated on [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).

Outside my PhD, I enjoy rock climbing, playing guitar [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134851297@N04/), and making and drinking coffee.

I've recently moved my website from wordpress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This new website is hosted by [GitHub](http://www.github.com), using the [lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).
