This is a draft document/vignette that gets ggplot to display missingness into a plot. 


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(wakefield)
df <- 
  r_data_frame(
  n = 30,
  id,
  race,
  age,
  sex,
  hour,
  iq,
  height,
  died,
  Scoring = rnorm,
  Smoker = valid
  ) %>%
  r_na(prob=.4)

```

```{r}

neato::ggplot_missing(df)

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = df,
       aes(x = Height,
           y = Age)) + 
  geom_point()

# idea was the plot the missing data as 10% below the minimum value for that variable.

df %>%
  # make missing values 10% below the minimum value for that variable
  mutate(Height = ifelse(is.na(Height), 
                         yes = min(Height, na.rm = T)*0.9,
                         no = Height),
         Age = ifelse(is.na(Age),
                      yes = min(Age, na.rm = T)*0.9,
                      no = Age)) %>%
           ggplot(data = .,
                  aes(x = Height,
                      y = Age)) + 
           geom_point()

```


```{r}

is.na.data.frame(df)

df.shadow <- as.data.frame(is.na.data.frame(df))

# make a function for creating a true/false shadow matrix
shadow_df <- function(x){
  x %>%
    is.na.data.frame %>%
    as.data.frame %>% 
    as_data_frame
}

# remember that TRUE = missing
shadow_df(df)


# Make a window function that transforms missing values to be 10% below the minimum value for that variable
shadow_shift <- function(x){
  ifelse(is.na(x), 
         yes = min(x, na.rm = T)*0.9,
         no = x)  
       # min() might change to something related to the data range
       # possibly use range() to determine the shadow shift
       # Need to also add some jitter/noise to these points to seperate out repeats of the same value
  # for factors, need to add another level (smaller than smallest)
  # need to think about how time is handled as well.
}


df %>%
  # make missing values 10% below the minimum value for that variable
  mutate(Height = shadow_shift(Height),
         Age = shadow_shift(Age)) %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         aes(x = Height,
             y = Age)) + 
  geom_point()

# OK, so it turns out that I can just shadow shift the data INSIDE ggplot.

ggplot(data = df,
       aes(x = shadow_shift(Height),
           y = shadow_shift(Age))) + 
  geom_point()

# now we just need to add in some colour to these points, so that missing data sorta takes upon this "preattentive" phase.

# let's make a new dataset, that is basically contains only the shifted data

df.test <- 
df %>%
  mutate(Height = shadow_shift(Height)) %>% 
  # filter out those observations that are greater than the min
  filter(Height < (min(Height, na.rm = T)*1.1))

df.test.2 <- 
df %>%
  mutate(Age = shadow_shift(Age)) %>% 
  # filter out those observations that are greater than the min
  filter(Age < (min(Age, na.rm = T)*1.1))

# to manage the different quantities of the variables, I could put them into a list, or something that allows me to have a "ragged" dataset

ggplot(data = df,
       aes(x = shadow_shift(Height),
           y = shadow_shift(Age))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = df.test,
             aes(x = Height),
             colour = "Red") + 
  geom_point(data = df.test.2,
             aes(y = Age),
             colour = "Red")


```

Possibly colour by `interaction`, which creates all the different combinations of levels of factors.



```{r, eval = F, echo = T}

a <- gl(2, 4, 8)
b <- gl(2, 2, 8, labels = c("ctrl", "treat"))
s <- gl(2, 1, 8, labels = c("M", "F"))

a
b
s

ggplot(data = df,
       aes(x = shadow_shift(Height),
           y = shadow_shift(Age))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = shadow_df(df),
             colour = interaction(Height, Age))


df %>% shadow_df %>% select(Height, Age) %>% interaction

interaction()

```


Next step is to think about what sort of plots could be handled by this approach.

- 1D, univaritae distribution plots
- Categorical variables
- Bivariate plots: Scatterplots, Density overlays, 

Things to do:

- Make it as a simple R packge with an R folder file, make Di a Collaborator. https://github.com/dicook
